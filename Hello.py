    We've trained a ML model using a cleaned dataset from the original database published in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires)
    before that, we've added County, Population and Area information and also the mean temperature per County level.

    The ML model uses a Random Forest Classifier with an accuracy of 70% (n_estimatiors=10) that could be improved up to 80%
    if we increase the number of iterations but would overflow the size of the serialized output.

    Here we focus on County level of granularity with a mixed measure of FIRE COUNTS in a selected period of YEARS.

    You can hover the mouse over the different counties to check the number of fires; there are counties with A LOT of fires over the time
    of course with different causes and sizes.
