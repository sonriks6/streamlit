    Wildfires in the USA are progressing over time (especially in California, Georgia, Texas) 
    as well as their size (Arizona).
    
    
    The fires are increasingly devastating in terms of area 
    (class G is growing by 28% per year) and it is likely that with global warming and very dry
    summers this number will increase (increase in natural causes of fires).

    """

    Construction (e.g. CA) increasingly close to forests, combined with the fact that 
    80% of the causes of fires are of human origin increases the risk. For human causes,
    prevention remains a good way to reduce the number of fires.
