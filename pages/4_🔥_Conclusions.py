    Wildfires in the USA are progressing over time (especially in California, Georgia and Texas) 
    as well as their size (Arizona).
    
    The fires are devastating in terms of area (class G is growing by 28% per year) and it is likely 
    that with global warming and very dry summers this number will increase (growth in natural causes of fires).

st.subheader('HUMAN CAUSES:')

    """

    Construction (e.g. CA) is increasing close to the forests, that combined with the fact that 
    80% of the causes of fires are of human origin leads to a higher risk. For human causes,
    prevention remains a good way to reduce the number of fires.

    The project allowed us to apply all the technical skills acquired during the training such as:
    
    - Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data exploration and transformation.
    
    - Scikitlearn, Streamlit for Machine Learning.
    
    - PowerBI for analysis, dashboard and presentation of results.

    All that remains is to apply this knowledge to our field of expertise!
