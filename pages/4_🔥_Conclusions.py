    Wildfires in the USA are progressing over time (especially in California, Georgia and Texas) 
    as well as their size (Arizona).
    
    The fires are devastating in terms of area (class G is growing year over year) and it is likely 
    that with global warming and very dry summers this number will keep increasing (growth in natural causes of fires).

    Seasonality, fire periods are longer, not only concentrated in summer, we have fires even on winter!.

    Human causes, are the main origin of wildfires, here revention remains a good way to reduce the number of fires.

    Climate zones: Mediterratean (CA) and Subtropical (South East) are the most impacted by fires.

    The project allowed us to apply all the technical skills acquired during the training such as:
    
    - Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data exploration and transformation.
    
    - Scikitlearn, Streamlit for Machine Learning.
    
    - PowerBI for analysis, dashboard and presentation of results.

    Aside the technical skills we also learned how to structure the analysis of an unknown domain, do the rearch and
    complementary data collection. All that remains is to apply this knowledge to our field of expertise!

    We would complete our knowledge in this matter adding more features and extra data.
    Add interesting new feature like an Fire Risk Estimator or compare with another country.    
    We'd also try to get a robust analysis and conclusions.
